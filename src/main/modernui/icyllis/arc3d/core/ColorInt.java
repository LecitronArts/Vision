/**
 * Denotes that the annotated element represents a packed 32-bit ARGB color value,
 * un-premultiplied, {@code AARRGGBB}. If applied to an int array, every element
 * in the array represents a color integer. This matches the format of
 * {@link ImageInfo#CT_BGRA_8888}. Color ints are used to specify colors in paint
 * and in gradients.
 * <p>
 * Color that is premultiplied has the same component values as color that is
 * un-premultiplied if alpha is 255, fully opaque, although it may have the
 * component values in a different order.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <pre>{@code
 *  public abstract void setColor(@ColorInt int color);
 * }</pre>
