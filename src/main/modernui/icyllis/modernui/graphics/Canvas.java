/**
 * A Canvas provides an interface for drawing 2D geometries, images, and how the
 * drawing is clipped and transformed. 2D geometries may include points, lines,
 * triangles, rectangles, rounded rectangles, circular arcs, quadratic curves, etc.
 * <p>
 * A Canvas and a Paint together provide the state to draw into Surface or Device.
 * Each Canvas draw call transforms the geometry of the object by the pre-multiplication
 * of all transform matrices in the stack. The transformed geometry is clipped by
 * the intersection of all clip values in the stack. The Canvas draw calls use Paint
 * to supply drawing state such as color, text size, stroke width, filter and so on.
 * <p>
 * A surface canvas will quickly compute, optimize and generate the data required by
 * the underlying 3D graphics API on the application side (client rendering pipeline).
 * The render tasks will be transmitted to GPU on render thread (deferred rendering),
 * determined by the drawing device.
 * <p>
 * A recording canvas records draw calls to a surface canvas. Although deferred
 * rendering has been done in surface canvas, sometimes we don't need to update
 * animations or transformations on the client side, so we can save draw calls, and
 * don't need to update the buffer in GPU. This is not recommended for frequently
 * updated scenes.
 * <p>
 * The Canvas uses analytic geometry to draw geometry, instead of meshing or
 * tessellation. This will produce very high quality rendering results (analytical
 * solution rather than approximate solution), but requires GPU to solve cubic
 * equations for quadratic curves.
 * <p>
 * The Canvas supports multiple color buffers in one off-screen rendering target,
 * which can be used for many complex color blending and temporary operations.
 * Note that depth buffer and depth test is not enabled, Z ordering or transparency
 * sorting is required on the client pipeline before drawing onto the Canvas. All
 * layers are considered translucent and drawn from far to near.
 * <p>
 * For tree structures, each child canvas may use its transition layers for rendering.
 * These transition layers are designed for short-time alpha animation, and it avoids
 * creating a large number framebuffers.
 * <p>
 * The root canvas and device is backed by the main render target (a custom framebuffer).
 * Multisampling anti-aliasing (MSAA) should be always enabled.
 * <p>
 * The projection matrix is globally shared, and the one of surface canvas must be
 * an orthographic projection matrix. Canvas's matrix stack is the local model view
 * matrix on client side, it should be an affine transformation. The pipeline will
 * calculate the world coordinates in advance.
 * <p>
 * This API is stable.
