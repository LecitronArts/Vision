 * The {@link VkBackendContext} contains all the base Vulkan objects needed by the

 * them to the {@link VulkanDevice} constructor. The {@link VulkanDevice} created must
 * support at least one graphics queue, which is passed in as well.
 * The QueueFamilyIndex must match the family of the given queue. It is needed for CommandPool
 * creation, and any BackendObjects handed to us (e.g., for wrapped textures) needs to be created
 * in or transitioned to that family. The refs held by members of this struct must be released
 * (either by deleting the struct or manually releasing the refs) before the underlying Vulkan
 * device and instance are destroyed.
